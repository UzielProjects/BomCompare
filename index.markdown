## The application

The BomCompare application is designed to compare BOM files with minimal user effort:

1. Import BOM files to each panel of the main window. (More info on [file formats](details.html)).
2. Or, _optionally_, open a saved BOM file.
3. **Note to which panel** the file is imported/loaded (The panel is highlighted).
4. Select the base file (highlighted panel) to compare (The selected file is used to convert **from** into the second file).
5. Click Tools/Report
6. If the files are not identical, a pop-up box is shown with an option to save the error report to a TXT file.
7. Use the info displayed in the bottom text box to repair the errors.
